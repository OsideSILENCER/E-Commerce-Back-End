# E-Commerce-Back-End

I was motivated by the idea of being able to create and deploy my own E-Commerce website to my own devices (primarily generating econimic revenue).

I built this project utilizing multiple javascript pages, sql, schema and gitignore. I had a plethora of issues and the serverfs are broke but they do run on insomnia.

#Installation In order to install the E-Commerce Back End page you must have a multitude of complex javascript pages featuring tag-seeds, routes and a gitignore. You must then ensure that the env and npm commands run properly as will all assignments. You must then npm install and after that renders npm start. Once you have confirmation that Port 3001 is active you then activate insomnia and create routes. Only then can run the back-end function successfully. 

#Usage In order to use the E-Commerce Back End sight run npm install and then npm start you can create your own seeded routes or utilize the the pre-seeds which ever one you choose you'll be able to utilize different function after creating routes on insomnia however the pre-seeds might not respond to commands.

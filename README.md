# E-Commerce-Back-End

I was motivated by the idea of being able to create and deploy my own E-Commerce website to my own devices (primarily generating econimic revenue).

I built this project utilizing multiple javascript pages, sql, schema and gitignore. I had no issues.

#Installation In order to install the E-Commerce Back End page you must have a multitude of complex javascript pages featuring tag-seeds, routes, seeds and a gitignore. You must then ensure that the env and npm commands run properly as will all assignments. Only then can you utiilize the website.

#Usage In order to use the E-Commerce Back End sight run the proper commands and then you should be able to see the pge created.
